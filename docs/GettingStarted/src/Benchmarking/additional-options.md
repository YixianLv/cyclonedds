## Additional options

Besides selecting the `mode`, you can also select the `options` to specify how to send and receive the data (such as modifying the reliable QoS from Reliable to Best-Effort with the `-u` option), or how to evaluate or view the data in the _ddsperf_tool.

The `options` you can select are listed in the _ddsperf_ `help` menu, as shown below.
