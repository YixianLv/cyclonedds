## Test your Installation

To test if your installation and configuration are working correctly, you can use the Cyclone DDS _ddsperf_ tool (`./ddsperf sanity`) or you can use the Hello World example.

To use the ddsperf tool, refer to [testing your network configuration.](Benchmarking/testing-your-network-configuration.html) 

The test using the Hello World example is explained in this section.
