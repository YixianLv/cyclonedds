## DDS-CXX Hello World Code anatomy

The previous chapter described the installation process that built implicitly or explicitly the C++ _Hello World!_ Example. The key concept of DDS was introduced in Chapter 3. 

This chapter starts by introducing the structural code of a simple system made by an application that publishes keyed messages and another one that subscribes and reads such data. Each message represents a data object that is uniquely identified with a key and a payload.
