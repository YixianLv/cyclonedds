### Building

To build the Cyclone DDS CXX, go into the folder directory and create a &quot;build&quot; folder to keep all the build files.

```
$ cd cyclonedds-cxx
$ mkdir build
```

Then, depending on whether you like to develop applications using Cyclone DDS CXX or contribute to it, you may follow different procedures.


For [application devleopers](InstallCycloneDDS-CXX/for-application-developers.html), go to the next section;

If you want to [contribute to Cyclone DDS](Appendix/CycloneDDS-CXX-contribute/index.html), refer to the appendix.
